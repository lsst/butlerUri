* Modified ``ResourcePath.join()`` to propagate fragments from the given path to the joined path.
This now means that if the ``ResourcePath`` constructor finds a fragment that fragment will be used.
Previously the fragment was dropped if a ``ResourcePath`` was given that had a fragment, or the fragment was treated as part of the filename if a plain string was given.
This change means that filenames can no longer include ``#`` characters.
* Added new ``ResourcePath.unquoted_fragment`` property to get the unquoted fragment.
